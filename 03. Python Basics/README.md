# Python Basics

This directory contains a series of Jupyter Notebook files that cover the basics of Python programming. Each file focuses on a specific topic or concept in Python.

## Files

1. **01. Syntax.ipynb**
   - This file introduces the basic syntax of Python, including printing to the console, variables, and data types.

2. **02. Comments.ipynb**
   - This file demonstrates how to use comments in Python code.

3. **03. Data Types.ipynb**
   - This file explores the various data types available in Python, such as strings, numbers, lists, and dictionaries.

4. **04. Numbers.ipynb**
   - This file covers the different numeric data types in Python, including integers, floats, and complex numbers.

5. **09. While Loops.ipynb**
   - This file introduces the `while` loop in Python, which allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

6. **10. For Loops.ipynb**
   - This file covers the `for` loop in Python, which is used to iterate over sequences (such as lists, tuples, or strings).

7. **11. Functions.ipynb**
   - This file demonstrates how to define and use functions in Python.

8. **18. Modules.ipynb**
   - This file explains how to use modules in Python, which allow you to organize and reuse code.

9. **19. Dates.ipynb**
   - This file shows how to work with dates and times in Python using the `datetime` module.

10. **20. Math.ipynb**
    - This file covers some of the basic mathematical functions and operations available in Python.

11. **23. Pip.ipynb**
    - This file demonstrates how to use the `pip` package manager to install and manage Python packages.

12. **27. Strings.ipynb**
    - This file explores various string manipulation techniques in Python.

Each file contains a series of code examples and explanations to help you understand the corresponding Python concept. Feel free to explore the files and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of Python.
